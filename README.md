# Executive Summary

Personal Finance Intelligent System (PFIS) is a modular, end-to-end financial analytics platform that transforms raw bank transaction data into structured intelligence, risk insights, predictive forecasts and executive-ready financial reports.

This system is not a static dashboard, it is a structured financial intelligence engine integrating:

- Data validation and cleansing
- Behavioral transaction categorization
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Composite financial health modeling
- Predictive expense & savings forecasting
- Automated insight generation
- Executive PDF reporting

Built as a production-grade final year project with scalability, explainability and system design principles in mind.

---

# System Architecture Overview

PFIS follows a layered modular architecture:

```
UI Layer (Streamlit)
        ↓
Business Logic Layer (utils/)
        ↓
Statistical & ML Layer
        ↓
Configuration Layer (config.py)
        ↓
Data Input Layer (CSV ingestion)
```

This separation ensures:

- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Config-driven system tuning
- Clean engineering practices
- Interview-defensible structure

---

# Core System Capabilities

---

## 1️⃣ Transaction Intelligence Engine

### ✔ Schema Validation
- Required column enforcement (`date`, `description`, `amount`)
- Currency symbol normalization
- Duplicate removal
- Chronological sorting
- Type coercion and null handling

### ✔ Categorization Framework
- Config-driven keyword classification
- Whole-word regex matching
- Income vs Expense inference
- Refund detection logic
- Extendable category system

### ✔ Time Feature Engineering
- Year, month, ISO week extraction
- `year_month` period construction
- Aggregation-ready time indexing

---

## 2️⃣ Anomaly & Risk Detection Layer

### Large Transaction Detection
Statistical thresholding:
```
Threshold = Mean + (k × Standard Deviation)
```
Configurable multiplier via `config.py`.

### Unsupervised ML Anomaly Detection
- Isolation Forest (Scikit-learn)
- Configurable contamination rate
- Applied only to expense behavior
- Ratio-based penalty modeling

This ensures explainability and risk quantification.

---

## 3️⃣ Financial Health Scoring Engine (0–100)

A composite scoring model incorporating:

- Savings Ratio
- Large Transaction Frequency
- Anomaly Ratio
- Spending Concentration Risk
- Monthly Stability Indicators

Mathematically structured as:

```
Final Score =
Base Score
+ Savings Contribution
- Risk Penalties
- Concentration Adjustment
```

All weights are configurable through `config.py`.

### Output Includes:
- Overall Health Score
- Ratio-based breakdown
- Monthly Health Trend visualization

---

## 4️⃣ Predictive Analytics Module

### Expense Forecasting
- Time-indexed Linear Regression
- Category-wise forecasting
- Future period generation
- Residual-based 95% confidence intervals

Model form:
```
Expense(t) = β0 + β1 × Time
```

### Savings Forecasting
- Derived from Income − Expense
- Trend-based projection
- Confidence interval bands
- Volatility awareness

Forecast horizon configurable.

---

## 5️⃣ Budget Intelligence Module

- Dynamic user-defined budget input
- Average monthly expense calculation
- Over-budget / Under-budget feedback
- Financial behavior signal generation

---

## 6️⃣ Automated Insight Engine

Rule-based financial heuristics generate:

- Savings discipline classification
- Spending concentration warnings
- Anomaly frequency alerts
- Monthly savings volatility detection
- Behavioral risk commentary

Insight generation is deterministic, explainable, and data-driven.

---

## 7️⃣ Executive Report Generator

PDF generation using ReportLab including:

- Income / Expense summary
- Net savings
- Financial health breakdown
- Risk indicators
- Automated insights
- Professional structured layout

Designed for executive presentation.
